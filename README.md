### Description of game

  It is a choose your own adventure, where you choose your role and your path to vanquish the Anomaly. 
  
  This game was designed and implemented using HTML, CSS, and Javascript while attending the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly. Since young, i have love playing RPG games, thus choosing something similar to engineer will test my innovative abilities and the application techniques i have learnt in GA. 

  As choose your own adventure is really about choosing your own adventure, there millions of possiblities, structures and outcomes of the game. I decided to go with a "dugeons and dragons" type of path, while implementing RNG components during fights with boss in the game. 

### Summarised review after completion

 During the planning phase, i had tons of idea and had mapped out multiple fights where you can go to while experienceing even more win/death scenarios. 
 
 My first draft in file rpg.js had everything planned out, BUT it was very bad coding. The state of the game was not implemented and most of the pages were hardcoded in to function in a very unorganised method. 
 
 The second draft in rpg2 and rpg3 was better, i had understand what it means to find your state of game and the variables/constants associated to it to implment a more organized code. Same as before, i tried to implment my initial drafts but to a certain extend. There were many problems faced and time was running out.
 
 The final draft rpg4. I was able to keep the RNG system in the game while cutting back on the paths i intially planned to have. Although MVP was met, i am slightly sad as whatever i had planned out did not come to fruition. 
 Even thought things didnt turned out as planned, this was a tremendous learning oppurtunity for me. I am now even more excited to see whats next.

### Future state of 3End-venture

- Implment initial drafts to game. (Start/Main Page, Credit rolls after win, initial path options)
- Improve RNG for boss fights.
- Implement moving visual and effects.
